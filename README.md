## Weekly Goal Tracker Plugin for Obsidian
This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) that allows you to add buttons to the status bar that allow you to track of different weekly goals and update them with ease. For example you could track a weekly exercise goal. The data is stored in the frontmatter of the Monday note for the current week, or in the current weekly note. 
## Usage
### When the button is closed, it displays an icon, the current value and the goal value

### When the goal has been reached, the button displays in color

### Using left click, the button can opened to show a progress bar in color

### **While the button is open, use right click to +1 to the goal. Hold shift and use right click to -1 from the goal**

## Settings
- Frontmatter value : the value in the frontmatter to read and write to
- Icon : the icon displayed in the status bar button. I recommend using [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) to find icons
- Goal : the weekly goal for activity
- Start color/end color : the gradient color for the status bar button, from left to right
- ÊŒ/v : change the order in which buttons appear in the status bar
